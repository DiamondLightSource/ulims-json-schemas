# Samples schema set

A set of schemas for use by the sample service.

## Schema groups or schemas available

The following folders should be created when needed.

* **shared** - contains schema that can be referenced by
  any samples schema.

* **instrument** - each instrument should have its own
  folder (whose name uses lower case) to isolate
  their schema.
