# 1.0.0 (May 2025)
- First release of basic schema with 4 properties (ulims team)

# 1.0.1 (Aug 2025)
- Added is_confidential boolean as optional property. Discussion
  outstanding if it should become a required value. Hold of using
  this schema as a $ref until a decision is made to avoid them
  also needing a major number increment. Already in use
  by /examples/advanced/ which is pinned at first release.
